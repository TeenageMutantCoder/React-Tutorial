# React-Tutorial
## Tic-Tac-Toe game made using the React tutorial

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with time-traveling abilities. You can look back at and change previous moves. 
To make this, I followed the [React JS tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I will make some changes to this as further practice.

### How to Run
**According to React docs, must have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 installed**
1. Clone the repository using `git glone https://github.com/TeenageMutantCoder/React-Tutorial`.
2. Change to that directory using cmd or terminal using `cd React-Tutorial`.
3. Run the command `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
