# React-Tutorial
## Tic-Tac-Toe game made using the React tutorial

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with time-traveling abilities. You can look back at and change previous moves. 
To make this, I followed the [React JS tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I will make some changes to this as further practice.

### How to Run
**According to React docs, must have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 installed**
1. Clone the repository using `git glone https://github.com/TeenageMutantCoder/React-Tutorial`.
2. Change to that directory using cmd or terminal with the command `cd React-Tutorial`.
3. Run the command `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [ ] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [ ] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
